# Solar Power Sensor LPS-1

A simple remote sensing node to monitor the voltage and load current for a solar/battery unit.
This unit brings together the prototype projects [Gateway Node](https://github.com/SteveMayze/leawood_gateway),  [Atmega1608 Development board](https://github.com/SteveMayze/atmega1608_dev) and [Sensor node firmware (Atmega1608 and INA219)](https://github.com/SteveMayze/PowerSensor-Atmega1608) to create a unified PCB that can be deployed to the field to make a connection to the gateway project in order to transfer the sensor data to the internet.
